# The important thing to keep in mind here is that we still need to create
# setter methods if we want to modify the attributes of our object. Just
# because instance variables were initialized to the state of an object
# doesn't mean this functionality is implemented. We still need to impliment
# this in a custom manner to ensure proper case
